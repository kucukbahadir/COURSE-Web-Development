# Assignment "Synthesis & Evaluation"

In this assignment you write a self-evaluation report in HTML5, using a text
editor as in the other assignments. The report is an evaluation of the
**functionality** of the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code you created for
Assignment 1 and Assignment 2. For this, you use two sources:

```
1. The W3C Accessibility Guidelines (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
2. Feedback you received from your TAs on Assignment 1 and 2.
```
## Source 1: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines

```
Evaluate the accessibility of your page according to the W3C Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
You can limit the evaluation to Principle 1 "Perceivable - Information and
user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can
perceive", Guidelines 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4, and Principle 2 "Operable - User
interface components and navigation must be operable.", Guidelines 2.
and 2.4.
Assess whether your page meets the requirements for success criteria
level A. For each guideline, briefly explain why your page complies or fails
to comply to the given guideline. In case you think the guideline does not
apply to your page, indicate why. Compile the results into an HTML table.
Include this table as "Appendix A" in your self-evaluation report.
```

## Source 2: TA Feedback Assignment 1 & 2

```
Collect the feedback your received from your TAs on Assignment 1 and 2.
Indicate for each item in mentioned in the feedback whether the feedback is
related to
a technical implementation detail that has no impact on the usability or
accessibility of your page (e.g. "your code has sloppy indentation")
a positive aspect of your submission that improves usability or
accessibility (e.g. "your navigation links on the top of your page make the
long page easy to navigate")
a potentially negative aspect of your submission that could be used to
improve the usability or accessibility of your page (e.g. "your page relies
too much on layout, the HTML without your CSS style sheet would be
unusable")
Compile the results into an HTML table. Include this table as "Appendix B"
in your self-evaluation report.
```
# Self-evaluation report

Write an report (in HTML5) that describes the findings of your evaluation,
typically containing:

```
Front matter section with the title, date of the evaluation, group number,
author name(s)
Introduction section providing a high-level overview of your page in terms of
accessibility and/or usability (max 200 words)
Accessibility highlights section providing a short discussion of what you
identify to be the WCAG guidelines that are the most relevant to your page
(pick 2 or 3)
Improvement plan section providing a prioritized list of improvement actions
to improve your page, in terms of- accessibility and usability (based on
Appendix A),- other course learning goals (based on Appendix B)- the
```

```
A4 rubrik
```
```
selected high lights, and the other material in the appendixes. For each
item, describe what you aim to improve, and what modifications in the
HTML, CSS or JavaScript are required to realize the improvement (e.g. to
improve the user experience in screen readers, HTML alt tags with short
texts describing the image need to be added for all img elements).
Appendix A & B (as tables) with more detailed information as described
above
```
# Implementation of the improvement plan

As a final step, you implement the improvements you have described in your
improvement plan. If you find that you cannot implement one or more
improvements, please indicate this in your improvement plan, along with the
reason why (doing so will be awarded with more points than simply deleting
improvements from your plan!).

Note that the bonus for assignment 3 also applies to assignment 4. So if you
did not have time for the assignment 3 bonus, you get a second chance.
Maximum 10 out of 100 extra points if you make your assignment 2
submission work with your assignment 3 server, instead of using our server,
and extend the JavaScript in the user interface to support all CRUD operations
(including update, delete). Bonus points already received for assignment 3 will
not be awarded again for assignment 4.
