        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Accessibility and Usability of a website are significant features to show the quality of a website.
            Having taken into consideration that, This website is designed by showing the functionality of the website
            to all users as well as ensuring the accessibility of content to users with certain disabilities .
        </p>
        <p>
            The accessibility and  the usability aspects of the website is to include alternate
            text descriptions to non-text content such as images. The appearance, surroundings and
            colors  are involved. The time limitation prevent to create an accessible and usable content, some principle guidelines
            is not met. In this evaluation report, the different criterion unmet with methods on how the website can
            improve to fulfill the unmatched criteria is discussed.

    <section class="accessibility">
        <h2>Accessibility Features</h2>
        <p>
            In this section,the key factors that makes the website accessible
            will be issued and some aspects of the website that has a potential negative impact on the accessibility
            will be evaluated in the lights of W C A G guidelines. Furthermore,
            You can see and compare each features as a table. <a href='#appendixA'> Appendix A</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, the accessibility of the website provides
            alternate text information to image files on the page. These alternate texts were
            implemented through the usage of alt' attributes within an 'img' tag. Moreover,
            these alternate tags contain a brief description of the image, ensuring to use words involving colors and
            surroundings to enable the text to equally convey an information as the actually image does. This
            is highly applicable to the W C A G guideline 1.1 criteria <a href="#1.1.1"> 1.1.1</a> where is mentioned
            that " A website should provide text alternatives for non-text content, serving an equal purpose in conveying
            information. To sum up, W C A G guideline is highly relevant to the website in a
            positive aspect; allowing visually impaired users to perceive the image being displayed on the page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Secondly, the website distinguishes the content from the
            background. This was mainly done by the use of color as the only visual mean of conveying information
            to the user. For instance, the website has links in the body and footer that involves colors
            to indicate whether the link has been visited or unvisited as well as using bolded text to convey importance
            of information and headers. this is highly relevant to the W C A G guideline 1.4,
            criteria <a href="#1.4.1">1.4.1</a>. Yet, this can be issue for the color blind people.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally,  the navigability of the website in W C A G guideline <strong>2.4</strong>  provide a great significance
            to the website. The success criteria <a href="#2.4.1">2.4.1</a>,
            <a href="#2.4.2">2.4.2</a> and <a href="#2.4.4">2.4.4</a> are met. This is done by including descriptive
            links that give to the user its purpose just by reading the link text(2.4.4). Headers and
            titles are able to give the overview of the topic of each content(2.4.2) and
            they include links in the navigation bar which bypass other unwanted blocks to lead  the user through the place of the
            each content(2.4.1).

            <h4>Improvements according to Appendix A table</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1.1.1 - The website consists this functionality. For the non-text content e.g. the images and background images, we have included alt tags to all images and we have a title for the background image in the body</li>
                <li>1.2.1 - We are not able to include this because we didn't include any prerecorded Audio and Videos. But we embedded videos from the youtube</li>
                <li>1.2.2 - We are not able to include this because we didn't include any prerecorded Audio and Videos. But we embedded videos from the youtube</li>
                <li>1.2.3 - We are not able to this because we didn't include any prerecorded Audio and Videos. But we embedded videos from the youtube</li>
                <li>1.4.1 - We added an underline for visited links to improve the website for the aspect of distinguishing the difference.</li>
                <li>1.4.2 - We are not able to include this because we didn't include any prerecorded Audio and Videos. But we embedded videos from the youtube</li>
                <li>2.1.1 - We are not able to improve upon this success criteria as it involves coding keyboard patterns and customising keyboard keys in order to ensure that everything is accessible with only a keyboard. Due to the time constraint we could not add the necessary javascript codes to achieve this on time. </li>
                <li>2.1.2 - We are not able to improve upon this success criteria as it involves coding keyboard patterns and customising keyboard keys in order to ensure that everything is accessible with only a keyboard. Due to the time constraint we could not add the necessary javascript codes to achieve this on time.</li>
                <li>2.4.1 - The are consist this functionality, when the user clicks on a navigation link, the link takes the user to the wanted place/page.</li>
                <li>2.4.2 - The website consist this functionality. We included appropriate headers and titles to describe the topic and functionalities of the content it represents.</li>
                <li>2.4.3 - We are not able to improve upon this success criteria as it involves coding keyboard patterns</li>
                <li>2.4.4 - The website consist this functionality. In the website the link text describes exactly how the link functions.</li>

            <h4>Improvements according to Appendix B table based on the TA's feedback</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML a: We have added the dl, h2 and pre tags to the website.</li>
                <li>HTML b: We couldn't manage to wrap the table around the form </li>
                <li>HTML c: </li>
                <li>HTML d:</li>
                <li>HTML e: </li>
                <li>CSS a: </li>
                <li>CSS b: Good styling improves the user to read the code and to use the website in the way TA wants.</li>
                <li>CSS c: Good styling improves the user to read the code and to use the website in the way TA wants.</li>
                <li>CSS d: </li>
                <li>CSS e: the report clearly explored the differences in the compatibility of the website when we view it in different browsers.
                    However, we could have improved on making the website appear differently on different browser by adding extra CSS </li>
                <li>CSS f: Good styling improves the user to read the code and to use the website in the way TA wants.</li>
                <li>CSS g: Good styling improves the user to read the code and to use the website in the way TA wants.</li>
                <li>Scripting-Sortable tables: We are unable to implement the dynamic sorting table due to time constrain and a lack of understanding in what must be included to improve.</li>
                <li>Scripting-Reset button: We couldn't improve on this because we were given no feedback as the reset button is fully functional and meets all the criteria.</li>
                <li>Scripting-Dynamic table: We have ensured that the table sorts correctly by editing the JavaScript file.</li>
                <li>Scripting-Miscellaneous: We have changed the javascript document name to main.js.</li>
